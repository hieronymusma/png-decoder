# PNG-Decoder
This project is a png decoder. I've built it just for fun and to play a little bit around with rust.

# Usage
`cargo run --release -- <path to png>`

# Limitations
At the moment only ColorType 2 (COLOR) and no Interlace is supported. I will eventually expand the support for more color types.
